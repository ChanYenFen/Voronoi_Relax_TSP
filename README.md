VoronoiRelaxTSP is a computational drawing system that transforms image data into a coherent, optimized path using spatial reasoning and classic algorithmic techniques. Starting with density-aware point sampling based on image brightness, it applies iterative Voronoi relaxation to refine point distribution. Once stabilized, the system constructs a path using the Nearest Neighbor heuristic and improves it with a customized 2-opt optimization guided by spatial queries via quadtree acceleration.

The result is a visually engaging, efficient traversal of spaceâ€”ideal for generative art, pen plotting, or algorithmic design.
